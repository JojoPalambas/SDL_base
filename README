INTRODUCTION
------------

The purpose of this project is to create a base that could be used by almost
every SDL game project ever.

Its architecture both precise and permissive. It is precise because you should
use it in almost only one way possible, using the structures and functions
contained in the project. It is permissive because almost any kind of pixeled
game can be done using this, and non-pixeled games too (with some
modifications).


REQUIREMENTS
------------

Before using this, you should:
  * Know how to code in C language
  * Know a little bit of SDL manipulation


RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------

  * C Standard Library
  * SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_mixer modules


INSTALLATION
------------

This project comes with an example, a mini-game containing a main menu, a game
where the player has to make his character reach the red door or the blue door
using the directionnal and with the possibility to jump, a pause menu, a victory
menu and a game over menu. To play the game:
  * Compile it by typing "make" in the root
  * Play it by typing "./main" in the root
  * Remove compiled files by typing "make clean" in the root


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

  * If the program is not working properly
    - Check you have the recommended modules
    - Relaunch the game
    - Remove the compiled files and re-compile
    - Maybe try to solve the problem if indicated by the compiler or the game
    - Email me at gabriel.depotte@outlook.com and explain me the problem
